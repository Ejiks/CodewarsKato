4_permutation

In this kata you have to create all permutations of a non empty input string and remove duplicates, if present. This means, you have to shuffle all letters from the input in all possible orders.

Examples:

* With input 'a'
* Your function should return: ['a']
* With input 'ab'
* Your function should return ['ab', 'ba']
* With input 'aabb'
* Your function should return ['aabb', 'abab', 'abba', 'baab', 'baba', 'bbaa']
The order of the permutations doesn't matter.

8_Powers_of_2
Complete the function that takes a non-negative integer n as input, and returns a list of all the powers of 2 with the exponent ranging from 0 to n ( inclusive ).

7_Nickname_Generator

Write a function, nicknameGenerator that takes a string name as an argument and returns the first 3 or 4 letters as a nickname.

If the 3rd letter is a consonant, return the first 3 letters.

nickname("Robert") //=> "Rob"
nickname("Kimberly") //=> "Kim"
nickname("Samantha") //=> "Sam"
If the 3rd letter is a vowel, return the first 4 letters.

nickname("Jeannie") //=> "Jean"
nickname("Douglas") //=> "Doug"
nickname("Gregory") //=> "Greg"
If the string is less than 4 characters, return "Error: Name too short".

Notes:

Vowels are "aeiou", so discount the letter "y".
Input will always be a string.
Input will always have the first letter capitalised and the rest lowercase (e.g. Sam).
The input can be modified

5_Find the smallest
You have a positive number n consisting of digits. You can do at most one operation: Choosing the index of a digit in the number, remove this digit at that index and insert it back to another or at the same place in the number in order to find the smallest number you can get.

Task:
Return an array or a tuple or a string depending on the language (see "Sample Tests") with

the smallest number you got
the index i of the digit d you took, i as small as possible
the index j (as small as possible) where you insert this digit d to have the smallest number.
Examples:
smallest(261235) --> [126235, 2, 0] or (126235, 2, 0) or "126235, 2, 0"
126235 is the smallest number gotten by taking 1 at index 2 and putting it at index 0

smallest(209917) --> [29917, 0, 1] or ...

[29917, 1, 0] could be a solution too but index `i` in [29917, 1, 0] is greater than 
index `i` in [29917, 0, 1].
29917 is the smallest number gotten by taking 2 at index 0 and putting it at index 1 which gave 029917 which is the number 29917.

smallest(1000000) --> [1, 0, 6] or ...
Note
Have a look at "Sample Tests" to see the input and output in each language

5_Human Readable Time

Write a function, which takes a non-negative integer (seconds) as input and returns the time in a human-readable format (HH:MM:SS)

HH = hours, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 99
MM = minutes, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59
SS = seconds, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59
The maximum time never exceeds 359999 (99:59:59)

You can find some examples in the test fixtures.
