4_permutation

In this kata you have to create all permutations of a non empty input string and remove duplicates, if present. This means, you have to shuffle all letters from the input in all possible orders.

Examples:

* With input 'a'
* Your function should return: ['a']
* With input 'ab'
* Your function should return ['ab', 'ba']
* With input 'aabb'
* Your function should return ['aabb', 'abab', 'abba', 'baab', 'baba', 'bbaa']
The order of the permutations doesn't matter.
